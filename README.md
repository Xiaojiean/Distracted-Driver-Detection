I decided to create a CNN model in PyTorch to detect 10 different types of distracted drivers. The categories are:


   -c0: safe driving
   -c1: texting - right
   -c2: talking on the phone - right
   -c3: texting - left
   -c4: talking on the phone - left
   -c5: operating the radio
   -c6: drinking
   -c7: reaching behind
   -c8: hair and makeup
   -c9: talking to passenger
